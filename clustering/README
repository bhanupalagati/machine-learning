This section is filled with the clustering algorithms

we have two main clustering algorithms. they are
k-means clustering :
       here we will start from the zero clusters and we will go until where we are getting the best results. you have to specify the number 
       of clusters by yourself.
       
       
hierarchical clustering  :
       it will use some predefined methods to find out the best fitting clusters. this will start from n and reduce to the best fit among 
       others
